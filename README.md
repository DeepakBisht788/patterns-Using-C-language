This C program demonstrates various patterns that can be generated using loops and conditions. It showcases different types of patterns including square, triangle, pyramid, number patterns, and more, all using stars (*) and numbers. The value n is set to 5, which controls the size of the patterns. Below is a brief overview of the patterns and their expected outputs.
